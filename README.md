I have a M.Sc. in Physical Chemistry and Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. I am a bioinformatician and currently a postdoctoral fellow with the Exposome and Heredity Team at the Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health (CESP) in France. You can follow our group's GitHub page here: (https://github.com/CESP-ExpHer).

My current work focuses on the application of GWAS summary statistic data in Breast and Thyroid cancers.

I strongly believe in sharing all scripts, codes, and analyzed data with the scientific community, to allow for recalculation of procedures by other scientists and to identify any potential flaws or errors for the improvement of our understanding of life sciences. This is why I enjoy using GitHub.
