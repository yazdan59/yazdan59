I am a bioinformatician and now a postdoc fellowship at Exposome and Heredity Team at Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health (CESP), France. You could follow our group GitHub page here: (https://github.com/CESP-ExpHer). <br>
Now, I am working on application of GWAS summary statistics data in Breast and Thyroid cancers.<br>
I believe in sharing all scripts/codes/analyzed data to the scientific community to allow recalculation all the procedure by other scientists and find any potential flaws/errors for improvment of our understanding about life sciences. That is why I like using GitHub.<br>
Ph.D. in Bioinformatics <br>
