I am a bioinformatician and now a postdoc fellowship at Exposome and Heredity Team at Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health (CESP), France. <br>
I have some programming skills (such as R , MATLAB, bash script, and C).
Now, I am working on application of GWAS summary statistics data in Breast and Thyroid cancers.<br>
I believe in sharing all scripts/codes/analyzed data in order to others be able to recalculate all the procedure. That is why I like using GitHub.<br>
Ph.D. in Bioinformatics <br>
